### Repositories and FAIR

<font size="3">Repositories for research data objects can be generally divided into disciplinary and general-purpose repositories. 

Our analysis found that datasets in general-purpose repositories achieve, on average, a considerably higher FAIR score than datasets in disciplinary repositories, increasing data reusability. 

Although disciplinary repositories achieve a lower FAIR score on average, they have an advantage in that they provide research community-related metadata. We recommend that researchers work with repository providers to progressively increase the FAIRness of stored research data objects.</font>
