<font size="3">Research quality in the Berlin research environment is overwhelmingly perceived as good (88% saying it is "very good" or "somewhat good"). In stark contrast, only 46% perceive the material and institutional framework as good, being the lowest value for all aspects of the research environment. 

This juxtaposition is strongest for professors (framework seen as good by 24%), while researchers without a PhD see it more positively (rated as good by 56%). The overall trend, however, is for professors to see the research environment more positively. Scientists with a PhD typically give ratings between professors and non-PhDs. 

Open science is perceived to be well implemented (i.e., "very good" or "somewhat good") by 65%. However, only 9% think it is implemented "very well". While 19% of professors think so, only 6% of scientists without a PhD do. Importantly, the alternative "I cannot judge", not depicted here, was by far most often chosen for the open science option (24%), indicating that open science aspects are not as well known to or relevant for scientists as other aspects of the research environment.</font>
