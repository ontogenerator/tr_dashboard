<font size="3">86% of Charité researchers consider it "very important" or "fairly important" to expand open science practices in science as a whole. At the same time, only 1% do not consider it important. This is in line with the high value attributed to open science, as shown in figure 1. 

Scientists without a PhD overwhelmingly tend to find the expansion of open science important (94%), while for professors, this number is substantially lower (68%). This is in line with results in figure 3 – the higher the academic rank, the more researchers see open science as already well implemented, and the less do they see a need to expand it further.</font>
